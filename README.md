# Diveholic 🤿

Web based dive log made with all the best practices regarding user experience, accessibility and usability kept in mind. Fully open source :)

## Back story

I've been searching for a perfect dive log for use on my diving trips, but without much success. All of them were clunky, outdated, had bad user interface and experience. I gave up and started this project with one simple goal in mind: to take all my knowledge and experience and create the best dive log I can.
