# `Diveholic ü§ø`

Web based dive log made with all the best practices regarding user experience, accessibility and usability kept in mind. Fully open source :)

‚ö†Ô∏è Diveholic is built mobile first, the desktop experience isn't quite polished yet!

## Back story

I've been searching for an excellent dive log for use on my diving trips, but without much success. All of them were clunky, outdated, had bad user interface and experience. I gave up and started this project with one simple goal in mind: to take all my knowledge and experience and create the best dive log I'm able to.
